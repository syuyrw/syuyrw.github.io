                    The principle of white space is the idea that good design doesn't fill every possible space
                    with content. The Mcdonalds home page is a great example of white space. Looking at the above 
                    screenshot you can see that the design looks clean and easy on the eyes because they don't overwhelm
                    the user with tons of content, but rather they display what is necessary, with plenty of space in between 
                    each different piece of content.

                <p>
                    The principle of the rule of thirds is the idea that things are visually more pleasing to look at when they 
                    are layed out in thirds. If you look at the screenshot above, you can see that the website for GV Capital is 
                    a great example of the rule of thirds. All of the different bits of content are placed along the different thirds of 
                    the screen in a very clean and concise way.

                <p>
                    The principle of the rule of Visual Heirarchy is a very important one for businesses. It's the idea that the eye 
                    goes to the biggest, or most eye catching item on the screen first. YouTube uses this concept by making it so that 
                    the video thumbnails are the biggest thing on the screen, because that is the product they offer. If you click 
                    on a video thumbnail, they make money off of ad revenue.
